A couple basic rules about the maintainence of eg:

  0) I'm a bloody horrible maintainer, sometimes going for months without
     responding to inquiries/patches.  Yeah, I know, I deserve to be
     replaced.  Sorry.  Also, I turn down some good ideas.  And some good
     ideas that I turn down I suddenly change my mind on a year later.

  1) At any given time, all the tests should pass *if* running with
     corresponding git and eg versions (run 'eg --version' to check).  To
     run the tests:

     # See t/README for more details; note that the tests
     cd t/
     make -j2

  2) Version numbers (appearing on or near lines 4 & 27 of eg)
     a) For a release, the version number of eg should match the version of
        git it was tested against, see below for more details.  (New rule
        since v1.6.5.2)
     b) After a release of eg, the version string should have ".dev"
        appended to it.

  3) Having eg be tested against a certain version of git means both that
     the given version of git was in the path, but also that the tests were
     merged with the given version of git.git's t/ subdirectory (and
     updated as needed for eg-specific changes).  To merge with git.git's
     changes to t/:

       # Preliminaries
       tempdir=~/temp       # or whatever
       testversion=v1.6.5.2

       # Make a "filtered" clone of git.git's tests (all tagged releases anyway)
       git init --bare $tempdir
       cd /path/to/git.git/clone
       git fast-export $(git tag | grep -e $'^v[0-9\.]*$')             \
         --signed-tags=strip --tag-of-filtered-object=rewrite -- t/    \
         | (cd $tempdir && git fast-import --quiet --force)

       # Fetch this test history into the local eg project
       cd /path/to/eg
       eg remote add testing $tempdir
       eg config remote.testing.fetch +refs/tags/*:refs/remotes/git/*
       eg fetch --no-tags testing

       # Merge any new changes from the relevant version
       eg merge git/$testversion

       # Then, fix up any tests (particularly the needed -b flag to commit)
       # as needed and test and commit.
