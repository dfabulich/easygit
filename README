To use eg, simply put this directory in your path.  If you are familiar
with other version control systems, the syntax in eg is pretty similar
('eg commit', 'eg diff', 'eg info', etc.).

To help get you started, you can run
  eg help
which will provide a list of available subcommands.  You can also get help
on each subcommand; for example, running
  eg help commit
will explain how to commit and provide many examples of doing so.

Note: bash-completion-eg.sh is NOT needed to run eg; it's here just for
the people that have bash completion set up and want to use it with eg
(google for bash_completion if you want to know more or how to make use of
bash-completion-eg.sh).  All you need to run eg is to make sure the 'eg'
script is in your path.
